### Key Differentiators & Technical Highlights

- **Decentralized AI Access with Bitcoin Micropayments:**
  Seamlessly interact with **state-of-the-art AI models** (like GPT-4.1, Claude 4, and DeepSeekR1) facilitated by a **per-message Bitcoin micropayment system**. This architecture ensures **no subscription lock-in, no KYC requirements**, and **direct cost-efficiency (paying only sats per query)**, leveraging Bitcoin's native capabilities for borderless, private transactions.

- **Integrated Non-Custodial Bitcoin (Lightning & Ecash) Wallet:**Developed and integrated a **fully functional, NIP-60 Bitcoin Ecash wallet**. This includes robust support for the **Lightning Network** instant, low-cost transactions, **Chaumian Ecash** Anonymous Payments (Cashu Protocol) and the **Nostr Protocol** private key identity. The implementation specifically utilizes **NIP-60** for the Ecash wallet, enabling **secure, privacy-preserving token management directly within the applications local storage and the encrypted backups on Nostr relays**.

- **Nostr-Native Privacy & Data Sovereignty:**
  Engineered for **true privacy by design** through comprehensive **Nostr protocol integration**:

  - **NIP-44 End-to-End Encryption:** All chat conversations are **encrypted client-side** using your Nostr private key, ensuring that only the user can decrypt and access their data.
  - **Nostr Event-Based Chat Backup:** Every chat interaction is persisted as an **encrypted Nostr event**, enabling a decentralized and resilient backup on Nostr relays. This design ensures **user data follows them across devices without centralized storage**,
  - **Nostr Identity for User Authentication:** Leverages Nostr's inherent identity layer for **pseudonymous and censorship-resistant user authentication**, eliminating the need for traditional email/password setups and external identity providers.

- **Progressive Web App (PWA) Architecture:**
  Built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, offering offline capabilities, push notifications, and a native app-like experience across all devices. This modern web development approach ensures broad accessibility and a high-performance user interface.

- **Scalable Backend & Real-time AI Inference:**
  Utilizes technologies like **Redis for caching and resumable streams** to optimize real-time AI inference and manage conversational context efficiently. This demonstrates proficiency in designing scalable backend systems capable of handling dynamic AI interactions.
